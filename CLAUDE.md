# sonora

A native music streaming client, built with Rust and [GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)
(Zed's UI framework). Cargo workspace, edition 2024, resolver 3.

## Crate layout

```
crates/
  sonora/     binary: main, window, actions, asset registry, HTTP client shim, tray, dock
  views/      screens, shells (Workspace, FullscreenView) and app chrome
  state/      GPUI entities holding app state, and all async orchestration
  music/      provider traits and models in the root, one submodule per provider (no GPUI)
  storage/    the state.sqlite and cache.sqlite paths, schema and connection setup
  ui/         design system: theme, metrics, layout ladder and reusable elements
  router/     Destination enum, navigation history, Link trait
  input/      text input element, global actions and keybindings
  i18n/       Fluent localization: the `t!` macro, locale selection, embedded .ftl
  icons/      the icon packs: registry, active pack, path resolution, AssetSource
  embed/      build-script helper that walks a folder and writes include_bytes! literals
  webview/    a native browser window over a throwaway session, for cookie sign-ins and PO tokens
  widevine/   the Widevine CDM host, pssh and CENC fMP4 parsing, for any DRM'd provider
```

Dependency direction is strict. Do not create a back edge:

```
sonora → views → state → music
         state, music → storage
         state → webview
         music → widevine
         all ui-side crates → ui, router, input → ui → gpui
         every ui-side crate → i18n, icons → gpui
```

- `state` and `views` see only the traits and models in the root of `music`, never a provider
  module. Only `sonora/src/main.rs` names a concrete provider.
- `music` never depends on `gpui`. `ui` never knows about `music`, `state` or playback. Widgets
  that need app state live in `views/src/chrome/`.
- `music::engine` is the one playback engine and `music::stream` the one progressive download. A
  provider implements `engine::Fetch` and `stream::Body` rather than writing its own. The engine
  applies loudness normalisation, so a provider only reports a track's level through
  `Fetch::loudness`. Spotify is the one exception, because librespot decodes and normalises
  inside its own player.
- `music::drm` is the only way `state` and `views` reach protected playback. The CDM is never
  shipped in any artefact or package.

## Rules

- **Reuse before you build.** Check `crates/ui/src/lib.rs`, `crates/views/src/shared/` and
  `crates/views/src/chrome/` first, and extend an element with a builder method rather than
  writing a sibling. New elements copy the shape of `ui/src/button.rs`, including the
  `mem::take` and `refine` of caller styles.
- **Never call the Spotify Web API.** No `reqwest` to `api.spotify.com`, no client secret, no
  `rspotify`. Spotify data comes from librespot's `spclient`, and auth uses Spotify's own client id
  in `auth.rs`.
- **Never hardcode a color, radius or size.** Read them from `cx.theme()` and `theme.metrics`. A
  literal `px(…)` is allowed only for a local, non-scaling detail declared as a module `const`. A
  new color token goes into `Theme`, every `Theme::*()` constructor, `ThemeOverrides` and
  `apply_color!`.
- **Never write a bare breakpoint.** Use the `ui::Room` ladder, and classify width with
  `Chrome::room` or `Chrome::content`, never the raw viewport. A view whose layout depends on
  width observes `Chrome::entity(cx)`.
- **Every user-facing string comes from Fluent.** Add the key to `assets/i18n/en-US/main.ftl`. Other
  locales may lag. Never call `t!` in a constructor: store the key and resolve it in `render`.
  Counts use Fluent selectors. Log messages and `.context(…)` stay in English.
- **Network work runs on tokio.** Anything touching `MusicApi`, librespot or sockets goes inside
  `Io::global(cx).spawn`, awaited from `cx.spawn` and applied in `this.update` ending with
  `cx.notify()`. Store the returned `Task` in a field and never detach a data load. Network-backed
  features belong in a `state` entity, not a view. An entity that caches provider data clears on
  `SessionEvent::SignedOut`.
- **Never drive a player from a view.** Go through `state::Playback`.
- **Assets are picked up from their folder.** Drop an icon into `assets/icons/<pack>/` or a face
  into `assets/fonts/`. Call sites spell `"icons/<name>.svg"` and resolve it with `icons::path` at
  render.
- **Generated files are regenerated, never edited.** App icons come from
  `scripts/generate-icons.py`, `THIRD-PARTY.md` from `scripts/generate-notices.py`, the README
  translation table from `scripts/i18n-coverage.py`.
- **Do not add tests unless asked.** Offering is fine. Existing tests are `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`
  at the bottom of the file they cover.

## Building and checks

```sh
nix develop                    # or direnv allow
cargo run --locked --package sonora
cargo fmt
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```

The devShell has no `cargo` or `cargo-clippy`; those come from the system profile. The flake
packages the released binary only, so `nix build` never sees the working tree.
`.cargo/config.toml` links with mold on `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, so mold must be on PATH, or
build with `RUSTFLAGS=""`. `crates/widevine` compiles C++, so a C++ compiler is needed too.

Clippy is clean, `--all-targets` included, and stays that way. Boxed callback fields get a
module-local `type` alias rather than a `type_complexity` warning. The one `#[allow]` is
`reversed_empty_ranges` on the `clamp_range("abc", &(2..1))` test in `crates/ui/src/input/mod.rs`.

## Code style

- Every type and every function whose behaviour is not obvious from its name carries a `///`
  comment saying what it is for and what a caller has to know. One or two plain sentences.
- `use gpui::prelude::*;` then explicit imports. Traits are imported anonymously
  (`use ui::ActiveTheme as _;`).
- Module order: `use` block, `const`s, types, impls, private free helpers at the bottom.
- In render, prefer `.when()`, `.when_some()` and `.map()` over branching. Two-arm boolean choices
  use `match flag { true => …, false => … }`. Use let-else and return early.
- `anyhow::Result` at boundaries with lowercase `.context("cannot …")`. Logs are prefixed by
  subsystem (`"playback: …"`).
- Dependencies go in the root `[workspace.dependencies]`. `gpui` and `gpui_platform` are pinned to
  one git rev and move together.

## Commits

Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`, imperative, lowercase, no trailing period, no
body. Scopes in use: `views`, `ui`, `music`, `state`, `playback`, `player`, `settings`, `router`,
`local`, `sonora`, `nix`.

## Pull requests

One heading, one list, nothing else:

```markdown
## Summary

- add playlist create, rename, delete, visibility, and track mutation support
- add album and playlist queue actions
```

Bullets are lowercase, imperative, one line each, and describe behaviour rather than files.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Add to
`## [Unreleased]` as features land, under `Added`, `Changed` or `Fixed`. Entries say what someone
using Sonora can now do, in one or two short sentences, since the notes are posted to Discord.
Leave out work no user can observe. Cutting a release is the `release-sonora` skill.

## This copy (`jasonb589/sonora`)

This checkout is a fork maintained without a Rust toolchain: nothing here is built or tested
locally, and every check runs on GitHub Actions.

- **Code changes land through a PR with a green `ci` run** (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`,
  `cargo test --workspace --locked`, all on `windows-latest`). Write code in rustfmt's style by
  hand: `max_width` 100, comments are not reflowed, and a let-chain breaks before `&&`. A
  docs-only change may be pushed straight to `main`, which runs no workflow.
- **Releases.** `gh workflow run windows.yml -R jasonb589/sonora --ref main -f version=X`. The
  tag is `windows-X` (upstream's `v*` tags are never fetched, so they cannot collide), the title
  is that same version, and the notes put a hand-written "What's new" above the workflow's
  auto-generated "What's Changed". The installer is handed out from the release alone.
- **Translations.** `zh-CN` is kept at every key `en-US` has, and new keys are translated in the
  same change. `scripts/i18n-coverage.py` needs Python this machine does not have, so the
  README's table is regenerated with the PowerShell port of it.
- **Upstream syncs use a merge commit, never a squash.** Squashing throws upstream's parents
  away, so the next sync replays every upstream commit since the last *shared* commit instead of
  the delta — the 0.42.2 sync paid for 0.42.1 a second time for exactly this reason. Merge
  `upstream/main` into `sync/upstream-X.Y.Z` and merge that branch into `main` with `--merge`.
- **Resolving a sync conflict:** ask which side changed the file since the last synced upstream
  commit, with `git diff <that commit> main -- <file>` against
  `git diff <that commit> upstream/main -- <file>`. One side changed it → take that side. Both
  changed it → merge by hand. `README.md`'s translation table is regenerated rather than merged.
  Afterwards check that the dead workflows this copy removed did not come back, that
  `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` are consistent, and that `zh-CN` covers the new keys.
